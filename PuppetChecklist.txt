A checklist for myself as I get this Puppet stuff going.

PuppetMaster Tasks:
	Create symlink from /etc/puppet to the checked out PuppetConfig repo

Not really automatable:
	setup /etc/sysconfig/network
		add DHCP_HOSTNAME=$(hostname)
	run agent setup script

Automatable:
	*add epel repo
	*yum install
		*vim-enhanced
		*wget
		*htop
		*ntp
		*tmux
		*git

	// All user steps here apply to other users later
	*create admin user
	*pull down sudo file to /etc/sudo.d/
	*setup ssh key login

	// admin specific
	*add vimrc file
	*pull down tmux config

	*pull down firewalld configs
	
	*pull down ntp file
		*one for centos-1 and one for rest
	
	*setup ntp to run on startup
	
	*Install OpenJDK via yum
	
	* add hadoop user/group
	* install hadoop
	* pull hadoop configs
	
	zookeeper
	
	hbase
	
	solr

	setup puppet agent to run on startup
