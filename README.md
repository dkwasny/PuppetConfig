PuppetConfig
============

An expanded reimplementation of my VMGridTools project with Puppet instead of homerolled nastiness.

I am also going to investigate packaging up the binaries I want as rpm files to better work with Puppet.
Once I get to acutally using these binaries, I will post dropbox links or something.

Currently, this setup is intended for CentOS 6 machines.
